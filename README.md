# Fix for the PLAY button of GameDistribution with Firefox

When an firefox user as to scroll to reach the play button, it might be unclickable. Because the button and the clickable area doesnâ€™t match.

So, I basically change the size of the game when a user scroll so GameDistribution could find where the Play button should be.
